    "# PS106A Voter Summary Analysis - Geographic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Ian Castro, Fall 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! This notebook is designed to help speed up your analysis for the Political Science 106A: Campaign Media voter summary assignment. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, these are ways data scientists share Python code and analyses in an easy-to-read format. You do not need to know how to use Python to use this notebook, but if you are interested, check out the offerings from UC Berkeley's Data Science Education Program. Please refer to Professor Schnur's emails and the bCourses for the full prompt and all parts necessary for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will focus on the **geographic** data analysis which will take most of your time. For the demographic analysis, I recommend working on that strictly in an Excel/Google sheet and keeping your analysis there, because there is a lot less data and it should already be grouped. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to use this notebook, you need to:\n",
    "> 1. Upload your data to the directory with this notebook\n",
    "> 2. Run cells by pressing Shift + Enter\n",
    "\n",
    "*Make sure you follow the instructions to ensure that this works.* You can find example datasets in bCourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best of luck! If you have any questions or issues navigating this assignment, email castro.ian@berkeley.edu."
